# Capstone Project
Ideas for my Capstone project

Following are 3 ideas I find interesting enough to explore further:

1. Soccer results prediction: Currently bookies use form and past results as an indicator to predict chances of a particular result for a team. But the accuracy of bookies' predictions have always been debatable. My goal would be to enhance the accuracy of the prediction by adding more variables to the model.

2. US presidential election: Predicting the US presidential election based on states' voting patterns. I am looking into additional variables to include in the proposed model.

3. Predicting probability of a cardiac arrest: Analyse the possibility of an individual having a cardiac arrest by analyzing his medical history,  lifestyle patterns and any other variables that might be good indicators of leading causes of cardiac arrests.
