Ideas for my Capstone project

This is my project landing page. I will be presenting my project ideas here.

Following are 3 ideas I find interesting enough to explore further:

1. My firm sells investment products to institutional advisors. We usually have wholesalers visit advisors and promote our products to them. We spend an amount to cover the wholesaler's travel expenses. Also the wholesaler might visit the advisor more than once a week. We would like to know if what we are spending on the wholesalers is driving sales of our products and if they are also bringing in additional sales.
