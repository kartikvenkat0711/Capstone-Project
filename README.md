Ideas for my Capstone project

Following are 3 ideas I find interesting enough to explore further:

1. Our firm sells investment products to institutional advisors. We usually have wholesalers visit advisors and promote our products to them. We spend an amount to cover the wholesaler's travel expenses. Also the wholesaler might visit the advisor more than once a week. We would like to know how the wholesalers' interaction with our IPs is driving sales of our products and if they are also bringing in additional sales. We have data for meeting details, investment professionals (customers), sales employees and customer revenue.

2.
